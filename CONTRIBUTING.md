# Contributing

This project is for Tigard High School's game submission to OGPC and as such we are not accepting pull
requests from individuals outside of Tigard High students. If you have any suggestions please raise an issue however, we are not allowed to accept outside
help for implementation. For this reason, we ask that you keep your suggestions as general as possible without including any specific code snippets.

## Game Club Members

If you are a member of the Tigard High School Game Development Club congratulations! You are in the right place! We hope you share the same love for
programming and gaming that has driven us to be where we are today! Here are some basic steps to follow for contributing.

### Steps for Contributing

- Fork the repository and make a new branch for your changes.
  - We do this to avoid committing directly to main. It also has the side benefit of attaching each new branch to an individual.
- Make your changes and commit them to your branch.
  - It is recommended to make small changes at a time. Keeping a div small makes review quicker and prevents excessive time loss if something starts off wrong.
- Open a pull request to merge your branch into main.
  - If there is an issue to be closed, please include the phrase `closes #<issue number>` in the description of the pull request.
- Wait for a review from one of our team leaders.
  - This process can take some time so please don't be surprised or discouraged if multiple iterations of changes are requested. Usually, two approvals are required before we will merge your changes.
- Once your changes are approved we will update the changelog and merge your commits!
  - Updating the change log can take some time so it's not uncommon for a pull request to sit `ready to merge` for a while.

Any contributing questions can be directed to our team leaders, we are more than happy to help!

### Reviewing a Pull Request

We usually require two approvals before considering a pull request ready to merge. These reviews are mainly coming from our team leaders.
We encourage everyone to get involved in the review process of all PRs. Even if you are not a requested reviewer you can still leave a review, whether you think all changes look good or you see something that can be changed!

### Other Tips

Take a look at previous pull requests to see what our process looks like to get a better idea of how we write and review code.

We can't wait to receive your PR! If you have any questions please connect with any of our team leaders or join the discord!
