<h2 class="concept-subheading">Story</h2>
<p class="concept-description">A computer virus intended to simply make its creator money that has now gone rogue. It lurks in the background on computers all around the world, silently stealing people’s data with the hopes of eventually using it to obtain total control over them. 
  It's now up to a free, cheaply made antivirus to prevent a worldwide AI takeover.
</p>

<h2 class="concept-subheading">Gameplay</h2>
<p class="concept-description">Some of the gameplay features:</p>
<ul class="concept-list">
  <li>The Overseer: The parent software of the player character: a mentor and a guide for the player early on. </li>
  <img class="concept-image" src="../photos/! TheOverseer.png" alt="The Overseer">
  <li>The Shopkeeper: A software similar to the player, who’s been corrupted to the point of being unrecognizable. They now accept corrupted data as a currency, selling that data to mysterious third parties in exchange for useful items. </li>
  <img class="concept-image" src="../photos/Shopkeeper3.png" alt="The Shopkeeper.">
  <li>Corruption: The natural deterioration of software and its code accelerated into being incomprehensible jumbles of numbers and letters that is accepted as a currency by the shopkeeper. </li>
  <img class="concept-image" src="../photos/Eye10.png" alt="Corruption">
  <li>Corruption Wells: Computers so overrun by corruption that they've become solely reliant on it, absorbing it directly from the player to utilize it as raw energy.</li>
  <img class="concept-image" src="../photos/! CorruptionWell.png" alt="Corruption Well">
  <p> The Enemies </p>
  <li>The Virus - A computer virus intended to simply make its creator money that has now gone rogue. It lurks in the background on computers all around the world, silently stealing people’s data with the hopes of eventually using it to obtain total control over them. </li>
  <img class="concept-image" src="../photos/virus question mark.png" alt="The Virus">
  <li>Bug: A bug in a line of code that’s been so intensely corrupted that it manifested into an actual, mechanized cockroach. </li>
  <img class="concept-image" src="../photos/Bug1.png" alt="A green mechanical cockroach.">
  <li>Laptop Goon: The collective inability of the general public to use computers manifested as a physical being similarly to bugs. Tries (and usually fails) to click on the player character despite being completely unsure of what the player actually is. </li>
  <img class="concept-image" src="../photos/LaptopGoon_Sprite01.png" alt="Laptop Goon">
  <li>EY: A trojan malware disguising itself as an antivirus of its own. In reality, these wandering tanks of software hunt down all data and software that is yet to be corrupted, taking them down with only a few blasts of its laser eye. </li>
  <img class="concept-image" src="../photos/EY Body.png" alt="The EY">
  <li>Hackerman: The online avatars of the greatest hackers around the world. These ghostly strings of code have a knack for taking down security and antiviruses alike. They whip around extremely quickly, firing a continuous stream of attacks at anything in their way. </li>
  <img class="concept-image" src="../photos/! Hackerman 2.0.png" alt="Hackerman">

  <li>Overload: Deal more damage, but fire with lower accuracy.</li>
  <img class="concept-image" src="../photos/overload.png" alt="Overload">
  <li>Faulty Heatsink: Causes your bullets to explode on impact.</li>
  <img class="concept-image" src="../photos/faulty heatsink.png" alt="Faulty Heatsink">
  <li>Reverse Gun: Causes your bullets to ricochet off walls and enemies, damaging you if they hit you.</li>
  <img class="concept-image" src="../photos/RightBackAtYa Icon.png" alt="Reverse Gun">
  <li>Sniper Scope: Deal more damage when firing from farther away, but deal less damage when close to your targets.</li>
  <img class="concept-image" src="../photos/sniper scope.png" alt="Sniper Scope">
  <li>Dice gun: The clip size of your weapon changes randomly every time you reload.</li>
  <img class="concept-image" src="../photos/dice gun.png" alt="Dice Gun">
  <li>Supersonic bullets: These bullets fly much faster than others, and they can even pierce enemies.</li>
  <img class="concept-image" src="../photos/supersonic bullet(reupload).png" alt="Supersonic Bullets">
  <li>Glass cannon - Double your dealt damage, but reduce your max health by 50%.</li>
